# Weather-App

This is a full-stack weather application that provides hourly weather data for a specific location. The application is built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and leverages OpenWeatherMap's API to fetch the weather data. Redis is also used for caching the API responses to optimize performance and provide a seamless user experience.
